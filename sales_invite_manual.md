# Sales Invitation System Implementation

## Summary
The "Register as Sales Partner" option is now hidden from the public registration page. It can only be accessed via a specific invitation link generated by an administrator.

## Features Added
1.  **Registration Page (`/register`)**:
    - "Register as Sales Partner" checkbox is **HIDDEN** by default.
    - Checkbox appears ONLY if URL contains `?role_invite=sales`.
    - Auto-fills email/phone if `?contact=...` is present.

2.  **Admin Invitation UI (`/admin/invite`)**:
    - New page for Admins to input an email or phone number.
    - Generates a unique link: `http://.../register?role_invite=sales&contact=...`
    - (Mock) Backend endpoint created at `/api/admin/invite-sales`.

## How to use

### 1. Access the Admin Invite Page
- Ensure you are logged in as an **Admin**. (If you don't have an admin account, run `UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your_email';` in your database).
- Navigate to: `/admin/invite` (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/admin/invite`).

### 2. Generate an Invitation
- Enter the candidate's email (e.g., `sales@example.com`).
- Click "Generate Invitation Link".
- Copy the generated link.

### 3. Send & Register
- Send the link to the candidate.
- When they open it, they will see the Registration page with:
  - Their email pre-filled.
  - The "Register as Sales Partner" checkbox visible and auto-selected (or optional).
